                        As an enthusiastic learner and creative individual, I am passionate about exploring new domains and ideas in both technical and non-technical fields. My innate creativity drives me to identify and solve real-life problems, with an innovative approach to problem-solving. I am constantly seeking new challenges and opportunities to apply my problem-solving skills to make a meaningful impact.
                        I have enhanced and emerged as a growing individual in technical knowledge. I have learned some vast data structures and algorithms in this journey. I also have developed my knowledge of the operating system, database management systems, and concepts of object-orientedÂ programming.
